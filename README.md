<h1> Cane for people with visual impairment </h1>
<p>This project has been done with another 2 colleagues during a hackathon which lasted 48 hours. Our goal was a helping stick for visually impaired people. It used an ultrasonic sensor to detect any obstacles in front of the person making him/her know this by using vibrations.</p>
<p>Also, with an accelerometer we could detect if the cane had been dropped down and if so, a buzzer would have started ringing. We thought of a method that could make the person read the messages received on the phone using the Braille alphabet and 6 pins situated on the upper side of the stick together with a GSM module.</p>
